# Public Domain

The assets in this directory are all assets which were NOT created by me, but by artists who released their work into the public domain.
I am very greateful as this game would not be possible without their selfless work.

Should you recognize anything in this directory as not public domain, then let me know and provide me some proof, so I can replace it A.S.A.P.

Thank you.


## NOTE!

This text only applies if you see this file in the source directory. NOT when you find it in the "House Of Cards.jcr" file. The builder just dumps it in there, but can't tell it has no furhter context, and will just copy it in. The licenses are in the file table of that JCR6 file. "Jalondi view -a 'House of Cards.jcr'" can (if you have Jalondi installed) show these. The GUI tool Stach should also be able to show this.
