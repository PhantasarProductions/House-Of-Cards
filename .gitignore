# To prevent copyright infringements 
# ignore these directories.
#
# (These authors do allow their work to be included
# in games and such, but they do not always allow
# their files to be distributed separataly, which is
# acctually precisely what github, bitbucket and
# similar services do. Hence their inclusion in 
# this .gitignorefile
# The SCI builder should as a result be able to
# ignore this and games built should run normally, 
# however this stuff is then not included (and 
# the game can work without them). Full game 
# releases have this all covered (of course)
